# Manufacturing-Defect---EDA-Repair-Cost-Trends-analysis
This dataset contains simulated data related to manufacturing defects identified during quality control, including defect type, detection date, location within the product, severity level, inspection method used, and repair costs. It is crucial for improving product quality, reducing production waste, and enhancing process efficiency. By analyzing defect patterns, companies can identify root causes, optimize repair strategies, and minimize recurring issues.     
    
# Columns present in the dataset:
The dataset contains following 8 column having different atrribute and features:

defect_id: Unique identifier for each defect.

product_id: Identifier for the product associated with the defect.

defect_type: Type or category of the defect (e.g., cosmetic, functional, structural).

defect_date: Date when the defect was detected.

defect_location: Location within the product where the defect was found (e.g., surface, component).

severity: Severity level of the defect (e.g., minor, moderate, critical).

inspection_method: Method used to detect the defect (e.g., visual inspection, automated testing).


repair_cost: Cost incurred to repair the defect (in local currency).
